## **TEST PLAN**

Project name: Sailor

Group: Gruppo1

Focus: Test Plan

### **INTRODUCTION**

This document defines the test plan for the project “Sailor”.

The system needs to provide to user the possibility of buying different type of
services.

The testing routine will test the proper operation of the buying system and the
login system.

The results of the tests will be used to fix possible bugs and achieve a proper
working platform.

### **TERMINOLOGY**

Throughout this document will be used various terms, there will be a short
definition:

System: the complexity of the system architecture, front-end and back-end.

User: people who uses the system in order to make a purchase.

Site: front-end website.

Password & Username: unique credentials for the users in order to identify them.

### **ITEMS TESTED**

Items that will be tested during the current test:

-   Ability for a user to access the platform via username and password  
    Test Cases: 2.1

-   Ability of the system to manage an invalid login due to invalid credentials  
    Test Cases: 2.2, 2.3

-   Ability of the system to manage purchases  
    Test Cases: 2.4, 2.5

-   Ability of the system to manage redeems  
    Test Cases: 2.6, 2.7

### **APPROACH**

The tests will be conducted in a manual way on an offline environment in order
to ensure that the system won’t be manipulated during the tests.

Some features will be tested together but in different test cases, for example
the ability of the system to manage purchases.

### **ITEMS PASS & FAIL CRITERIA**

User experiencing will be determinant in order to meet the requirements, so in
order to be considered valid a feature must be easy to use for the user and,
most importantly, must be working.

In the opposite case, when a feature doesn’t accomplish its goal or the user is
not able to use it, it will be considered as a fail.
