### 1.1 _Overview_

The **OnGo** is an application that provides you access to all the files stored on your personal computer from _any device_ you want.

This document provides informations on the requirements for the **OnGo** application.  
Project goals, scope and definitions are given in the _introduction_.  
_Design constraints_ and _application environment_ are descrived in the following section.  
_Nonfunctional requirements_ are outlined for later verification.  
_Functional requirements_ are given to show the system features and expected user interaction.  
The _Software Project Management Plan_ will give specifics on project budget and schedule.

### 1.2 _Goals and Objectives_

The **main objective** of this project is to allow users to have an easy and quick access to any file stored on other devices. The OnGo application is expected to: 

* function in an **simple and intuitive** manner
