We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the website during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

- No one circles “No” on the first two questions
- If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved as soon as possible to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations.

##### Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan.
All critical defects found will be fixed. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled by our team on a sliding scale.
Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project.
Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

##### Community can easily log into the system.
