# Elevator Statement

OnGo is an application built to give _everyone_ the possibility to **access** their personal files and data in _real time_ and from _any location and device_. The OnGo application is a simple **Web App** that allows you to _remotely control_ your computer and to _directly access_ all the files stored. Unlike Google Drive, OneDrive or iCloud, OnGo _doesn’t keep any file stored_ in the cloud and doesn’t need any upload action by the user to make it available. Our product works as a _link_ between your home computer or work laptop maybe and the device that you want to use to connect to it, recovering all the needed files _on user request_ and automatically downloading them on the new device. All your data **available on any device**, this time for real.
