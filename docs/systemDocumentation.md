The staff dashboard is the page that contains all the orders from all the users. The staff will need to always keep a look on this page to make sure that every order is being succesfully forwarded to the supplier and occasionally forward it by hand before communicating the issue to the development team. Every order will contain the exact same informations as the one visible to the user but it will also contain the informations about the user who purchased it.
